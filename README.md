# Babyland

I used HTML and CSS to recreate one page of this [website template](https://www.templatemonster.com/website-templates/52818.html).

The focus of this project was to learn how floats work by using them exclusively to build the layout. The secondary focus was to learn how to use pseudo-classes (like :nth-of-type) to select elements in the stylesheet instead of adding clases and id's to every element (which can get messy and isn't necessary anyway).
